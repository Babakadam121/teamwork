	<p>Another term for a young rabbit is <b>bunny</b>, though this term is often applied informally (especially by children) to rabbits generally, especially domestic ones. Rabbits are often used as a symbol of fertility or rebirth, and have long been associated with spring and Easter as the Easter Bunny. </p> <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/ac/ec/e7/acece74d9001b0da5e94dee3709d5cab.jpg">If you like my bunny click here</a>
